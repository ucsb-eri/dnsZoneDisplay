Attempt at a simple node script to serve out DNS zone listings.

Idea is to use express and ejs to futz around with this stuff.

Will need to have some sort of config/settings to tell the server
where the files in question are located.  This will allow easier
creation of a dev environment.  Will make that a json
file of some sort.
